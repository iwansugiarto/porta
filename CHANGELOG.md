## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Telegram Bot bridge** — optional `@porta/telegram` package that bridges
  Antigravity conversations to Telegram via grammY. Communicates with the
  proxy over the same REST API + WebSocket used by the web UI.
  ([docs/telegram.md](docs/telegram.md))
  - Whitelist-based security: `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` and
    `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_GROUPS` control who can interact with the bot.
  - Real-time streaming responses via `editMessageText` with 1.5s batching.
  - Inline keyboard buttons for command and file-access approval.
  - Model selection: `/model <name>` to choose, `/models` to list available.
  - Photo/image support: send screenshots with captions to Antigravity.
  - Proactive completion notifications for tasks exceeding 30 seconds.
  - Auto-starts with `pnpm dev` when `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is configured;
    also available standalone via `pnpm dev:telegram`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **Cloudflare Access secured API proxy** — Cloudflare Pages can now route
  relative `/api/*` requests through a Pages Function that injects
  server-side Cloudflare Access service token headers for the protected backend
  API. The setup documentation now requires protecting both the Pages frontend
  and backend API with Cloudflare Access. (#40)
- Local Vite dev proxy support for `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` and
  `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`, making protected API development easier. (#40)

### Fixed

- **Deleted conversations now disappear from the sidebar immediately** after a
  successful delete request, instead of waiting for the next full refresh. (#42)
- Cloudflare Pages deploys now run Wrangler from the web package directory and
  deploy `./dist`, matching the Pages Functions layout. (#40)
- The Pages API proxy strips upstream `Set-Cookie` headers so backend
  Cloudflare Access cookies cannot overwrite the frontend Access session. (#40)

### Security

- Bumped `happy-dom` and related transitive dependencies. (#35)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- **Zero-config remote access via Tailscale** — new `pnpm dev:tailscale`
  command discovers the Tailscale IPv4 address, binds the proxy and web app to
  it, and configures CORS for the Tailscale origin. (#34)

### Changed

- The exposure guard now permits Tailscale CGNAT addresses only when explicitly
  enabled with `PORTA_TAILSCALE=1`. (#34)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Settings screen** — new settings panel accessible from the sidebar gear
  icon (⚙). Users can now configure persistent preferences that survive across
  sessions. Settings are stored globally in `localStorage`. (#5, #11)
- **Default model setting** — choose which model is pre-selected for new
  messages, instead of relying on the hardcoded constant.
- **Default planner type setting** — choose between Fast (conversational) and
  Plan (multi-step structured) as the default planner mode.
- New `useClientSettings` hook for global settings management with cross-tab
  sync via `storage` events.
- `SettingsPanel` component at `/:projectSlug/settings` route.
- `IconGear` and `IconChevronLeft` SVG icons.

### Fixed

- **PWA stale cache on deploy** — `index.html` is no longer precached by the
  Service Worker, and the `NavigationRoute` has been removed. Navigations now
  always hit the CDN, ensuring deployments take effect on the next reload
  without requiring users to clear caches or re-add the PWA. (#11)

### Changed

- Branch naming lint now bypasses the `develop` integration branch. (#13)

### Security

- Bumped `undici` to 7.24.1 (GHSA advisory). (#9)
- Bumped `express` and `cookie` in proxy dependencies. (#3)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Inline command approval UI** — when the agent proposes a command and waits
  for user confirmation (`CORTEX_STEP_STATUS_WAITING`), the web chat now
  displays Approve / Reject buttons directly on the command card, with a
  pulsing "Waiting for approval" indicator. Users no longer need to leave the
  web interface to resolve pending actions.
- Proxy route `POST /api/conversations/:id/command-action` for command
  approve/reject via `HandleCascadeUserInteraction` RPC.
- `api.commandAction()` client method.
- Retry on failure: if the approve/reject request fails, buttons reappear so
  the user can try again.
- Unit tests for `CommandCard` (8 tests: visibility, callbacks, retry, display logic).
- Edge test for `proposedCommandLine`-only steps in `stepsToMessages`.

### Fixed

- Steps with only `proposedCommandLine` (no `commandLine`) were silently
  dropped by `stepsToMessages`, making it impossible to render waiting
  command cards. Now included in the fallback chain.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-10
